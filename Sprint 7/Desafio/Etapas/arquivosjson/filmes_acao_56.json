Obvious question would be why didn't the cameraman warn him? The film tells the story of two explorers, George Breakston and Yorke Coplen, setting out to make a photographic record of animal life, and the lives of the tribes they encounter along the way. It is broken up into three segments---the journey from Nairobi to the Land of the Pgymies; the trip from there to the territory of the Masai tribe; and the Masai tribe itself.",
