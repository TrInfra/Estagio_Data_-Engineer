Afterwards, a 'spirit' visited Dagohoy in his dream. The following day, they seek Tamblot, a male Babaylan and revolutionary leader, to further heal Dagohoy's wounds. While performing the ritual of renewal and baptizing the new resistance fighters, the Friar saw the traditional baptism. He disapproves and challenges Tamblot, leading to a fight. After some time, while still constantly visited by the 'spirit,' the revolutionaries prepare for a significant uprising led by Dagohoy. Their battle cry for justice signals the beginning of 85 years of revolution.",
