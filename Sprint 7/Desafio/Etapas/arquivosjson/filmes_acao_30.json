It’s a shorter, more streamlined version of Nadia called \"The Nautilus Story\", which all but eliminates the filler arc and concentrates on the struggle between Nemo and Gargoyle. Some scenes in the more pivotal episodes are cut as well. The compilation series was made by Hideaki Anno, who was said to have been dissatisfied with the final result of the TV show. The Nautilus Story was only released in Japan on VHS and laserdisc.",
