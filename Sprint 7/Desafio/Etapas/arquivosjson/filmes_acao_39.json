        "overview": "Mauro Bosque was an adventurer, a survivalist, but most of all, he was a dreamer. Mauro spent his days exploring some of the most dangerous places in the world and sharing those adventures on his Internet reality show, HOMBRE Y TIERRA. In January of 2005 he sought out to explore the dense forests of Belize to search for a series of legendary caves which he believes were once home to a clan of historic Mayan warriors. While on that excursion, he was believed to have disappeared without a trace. What happened during that three day hike has remained a mystery until the recent discovery of classified footage stolen from a Belezian government office. This is the story of, Hombre Y Tierra.",
