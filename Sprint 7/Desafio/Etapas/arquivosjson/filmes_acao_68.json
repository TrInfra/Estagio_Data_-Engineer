I found this map in one of the many boxes in Harold's Hock Shop. The silly fool doesn't know an expensive item when he sees it. He was going to sell it to me for only ten gold pieces.  Anyway, I had the map in my grasp when that rotten scallywag Galifray took it right from under my nose.  Somehow the  scoundrel managed to trade it for a dragon bracelet. Harold also threw in a magic genie lamp for good luck! I don't know how Galifray does it but he sure has the gift of the gab.  I have managed to persuade Galifray to trade the map for the measly sum of a thousand gold pieces. We will meet you on Black Dragon Isle at the usual time.  Your trusty shipmate,  Sharky",

The first Mont Blanc 24 hour record was beaten by Marino Giacometti in 1997 (23hrs) and subsequently by Andrea Daprai in 2008 (18 hrs 58’). From that day on, Nico launched the project “From Zero To…” and continued to add records and summits (Aconcagua, Elbrus, Kilimanjaro). ”Summit” tells all the efforts that Nico and his team have made for making possible this epic challenge.",

The SBBCU originates from an Online LEGO Friend Group (Created in late October 2020), where all the members have chosen/created a mini figure that represents themselves. The SBBCU is similar to the MCU in ways that it’s an all a connected universe with many unique stories expressed through many different Stop Motion Animators. Also, all of the characters are voiced by themselves, (For instance, “Wrathful, Chiach, Rex, Zorii, etc” are all usernames for some of the members and so they voice themselves in the video).",
