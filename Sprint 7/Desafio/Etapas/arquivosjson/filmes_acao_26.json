Emilio's friend Alejandro, who sells pirated DVDs, has assembled a team of amateurs, who, as Alejandro says, will go unnoticed because they're immigrants. The team must gain entry to Silvestrini's well-guarded mansion, steal two keys to access a vault, and then get the money off the property. A father and his tomboy daughter, a nervous Cuban actor, a techie, and a muscle man make up the team, plus Alejandro has been courting Silvestrini's nanny. Will they be enough?",

Anabil, one of the alumnus, presently working with UNICEF India as a 'child protection specialist', narrates the story of his childhood days spent in the residential school. In his childhood, when he was admitted to the residential school by his parents, Anabil happened to be a very shy student possessing below average abilities.
