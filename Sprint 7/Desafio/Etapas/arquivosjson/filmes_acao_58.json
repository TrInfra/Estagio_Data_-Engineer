The lord dispatches the valiant fighter Lui Chen-sing to Chen on an assassination mission, but the assassin is vanquished. Si prevails on Lui of his patriotism. Lord Biu fights Chen. In a dire attempt to redeem Chen, Si surrenders to the Wu camp. Lui pretends to have blinded Si to extricate him. The duo ally with a band of chivalrous fighters to overturn the corrupt regime. Dispossessed of his throne, Biu commits suicide. Si returns to his land to serve as an aide to the young king and marry Fung-ming.",
